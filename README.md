# Classifier-Common
Within the RiPLes project, we implement multiple classifiers using the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) framework, and serialize them for later use in our project pipeline.

This package is intended to unify the implementation of these classifiers and cut down on redundant code.
